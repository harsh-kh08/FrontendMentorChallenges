### What I learned

I have learned how to test emal using RegEx expression and worked on Advanced CSS properties.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
const regex_pattern =
  /^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
```
